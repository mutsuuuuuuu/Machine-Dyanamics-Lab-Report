The laboratory experiments for this unit are divided into three different experiments where each experiment explores different topic in machine dynamics. The first experiment is about mass moment of inertia of an object, the second experiment is about belt friction around a pulley and the last experiment is about analysing gear speed ratio in planetary gear system. \\

The purpose of this report is to fulfill the aim of each experiment by analysing the experimental results using the formulae that are given in the lecture slides or the laboratory script itself.
