The aim of this experiment is to explore experimental techniques such as compound pendulum technique and trifilar suspension technique to determine the mass moment of inertia of an object.\\

The analysis below uses the experimental data sets that were published on machine dynamics blackboard. In this data sets, the assumptions are that a digital scale was used to measure the weight of the connecting rod and a standard 60cm ruler was used to measure the length of the connecting rod. In addition to those two apparatuses, a stopwatch that can measure 1/100 seconds was also used to calculate the oscillation period.  \\
