For this part, if we were to rotate the sun gear one full rotation clockwise, then the planet gear that mesh with the sun gear, $planet_1$ will rotate twice in the opposite direction (anti-clockwise). The planet gear that meshes with the annulus or ring gear $Planet_2$ will cause the ring gear to rotate only $\frac{1}{3}$ and its motion is on the opposite direction to the planet gear (clockwise direction).\\

Therefore, the velocity ratio between the input gear and the sun gear is given by:
\begin{align}
\frac{Input Gear}{Output Gear} &= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{3}} \notag \\
\qquad &= \frac{3}{1} \notag
\end{align}
Therefore, the input and the output gear has a ratio of $3:1$ or $1:\frac{1}{3}$.
